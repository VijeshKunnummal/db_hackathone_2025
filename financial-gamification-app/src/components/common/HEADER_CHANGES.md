# Header Component - Theme Selection Modal

## Changes Made

### 1. Theme Selection Modal Implementation
- **Modal View**: Theme selection is now displayed in a modal overlay instead of always-visible buttons
- **Auto-hide**: Modal automatically closes after theme selection
- **On-demand**: Theme options only show when the user clicks the theme toggle button

### 2. Improved User Experience
- **Current Theme Display**: The toggle button shows the current theme with an icon and name
- **Clean Interface**: No theme options cluttering the header until needed
- **Quick Selection**: Single click to open, single click to select and close

### 3. Accessibility Improvements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support with Escape key to close
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus handling when modal opens/closes
- **Screen Reader Support**: ARIA attributes for modal dialog and radio group
- **High Contrast Support**: Enhanced styling for high contrast mode

### 4. Keyboard Styling Fixes
- **Z-index Management**: Fixed potential conflicts between sign language keyboard tooltips and modal
- **Proper Layering**: Modal appears above all other interface elements
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear visual separation between modal and background content

## Usage

The Header component now provides:
1. A theme toggle button showing current theme
2. Modal popup for theme selection when clicked
3. Automatic modal closure after selection
4. Full keyboard and screen reader accessibility

## Technical Details

- **State Management**: Uses local React state for modal visibility
- **Focus Management**: Returns focus to trigger button after selection
- **Event Handling**: Escape key support and click-outside-to-close
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to mobile screens with proper touch targets
- **Performance**: Conditional rendering of modal to minimize DOM impact
