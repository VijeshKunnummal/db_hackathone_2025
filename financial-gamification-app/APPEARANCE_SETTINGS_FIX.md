# Appearance Settings - Hidden by Default

## Problem Fixed
The appearance settings area was always displayed on the webpage, creating visual clutter and poor user experience.

## Solution Implemented
✅ **Hidden by Default**: Appearance settings panel is now completely hidden until user clicks the toggle button
✅ **Auto-close on Selection**: Settings panel automatically closes after user makes a selection
✅ **Click Outside to Close**: Users can close the panel by clicking anywhere outside of it
✅ **Keyboard Support**: ESC key closes the panel for better accessibility

## Changes Made

### 1. StyleSelector Component (`StyleSelector.tsx`)
- **Auto-close functionality**: Added handlers that close the menu after theme/font selection
- **Keyboard support**: Added ESC key listener to close menu
- **Overlay support**: Added transparent overlay for click-outside-to-close functionality
- **Improved accessibility**: Added `aria-expanded` attribute to toggle button

### 2. StyleSelector CSS (`StyleSelector.css`)
- **Proper hiding**: Changed from `position: relative` to `position: fixed` with opacity/visibility controls
- **Smooth animations**: Added transform and opacity transitions for better UX
- **Overlay styling**: Added transparent overlay that covers entire screen
- **Responsive design**: Improved mobile positioning and sizing
- **Z-index management**: Proper layering to ensure menu appears above other content

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Visual feedback**: Smooth fade-in/fade-out animations
- **Clean interface**: Settings only appear when needed
- **Touch-friendly**: Proper mobile positioning and touch targets
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support and keyboard navigation

## How It Works Now

1. **Default State**: Appearance settings are completely hidden
2. **Toggle Open**: Click the gear/settings icon (top-right) to open settings panel
3. **Make Selection**: Click on any theme or font size option
4. **Auto-close**: Panel automatically closes after selection
5. **Manual Close**: 
   - Click the X button in the panel
   - Click anywhere outside the panel
   - Press ESC key

## Technical Implementation

### Before (Problem)
```css
.style-selector {
  position: relative;  /* Always taking up space */
  display: inline-block;
}
```

### After (Solution)
```css
.style-selector {
  position: fixed;
  opacity: 0;           /* Hidden by default */
  visibility: hidden;   /* Not interactive when hidden */
  transform: translateY(-10px) scale(0.95);
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

.style-selector.open {
  opacity: 1;           /* Visible when opened */
  visibility: visible;  /* Interactive when opened */
  transform: translateY(0) scale(1);
}
```
